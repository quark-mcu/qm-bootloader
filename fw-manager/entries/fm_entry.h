/**
 * Enter FM mode Macro.
 *
 * The behavior of this macro depends on the ENABLE_FIRMWARE_MANAGER build
 * option:
 *    - If ENABLE_FIRMWARE_MANAGER=uart, then the 'FM over UART' mode is
 * 	activated.
 *    - If ENABLE_FIRMWARE_MANAGER=2nd-stage, the 2nd-stage bootloader is
 *      executed; the actual transport used for FM will depend on the specific
 *      2nd-stage bootloader flashed.
 *    - If ENABLE_FIRMWARE_MANAGER=usb, then the 'FM over USB' mode is
 * 	activated.
 *
 * We rely on Makefile checks to prevent ENABLE_FIRMWARE_MANAGER values that
 * are not valid for a specific build (e.g., ENABLE_FIRMWARE_MANAGER=usb passed
 * when building the ROM or ENABLE_FIRMWARE_MANAGER=2nd-stage passed when
 * building the 2nd-stage).
